### Introduction

A Docker registry serves to manage Docker images in your organization, whether created internally or downloaded from remote Docker resources such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images.

#### Why use it
You should use the Registry if you want to:

- tightly control where your images are being stored
- fully own your images distribution pipeline
- integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow

This tutorial will guide you in setting up a **Private docker registry** in MegamAfrica.

### Prerequisites

* You are running Ubuntu 14.04 or Linux workstation.

* Git installed on your server, which you can do by following the How To Install Git with Apt.

* An account on GitHub, which is a Git repository host.

* You have to create a valid credential for accessing https://console.megamafrica.com.[How to create an account with MegamAfrica](http://devcenter.megam.io/2016/05/27/how-to-launch-ubuntu/).

#### Introducing Atharva Storage - MegamAfrica

**Atharva Storage** - MegamAfrica is a "Cloud object storage, low latency and (S3 - AWS Signature v2) compatible API  built on top of ceph - jewel.".

Upon successful signin to https://console.megamafrica.com, look for the icon

 at the top right hand corner named `Storage`

### To Deploy Private Docker Registry

This initial section contains everything you need to set private registry on your server.

##### Step-1 Creating Ubuntu VM

* First, ensure you can login to https://console.megamafrica.com.

*  Go to the Market Places.

* select the Ubuntu, A window will pop up with for CPU, storage, RAM and SSHkey options.

* You can choose the storage size, RAM capacity.

* You can Create a new sshkey, use an existing sshkey or import your own sshkeys too.

* Click the Create button. it will create the virtual machine.

##### Step-2 Creating a Bucket in our Storage

* Go to the Storage.

* Click the create storage button. it will open one pop-up window. You can create a bucket.

* Let us provide our bucket name as `docker-registry`.

##### Step-3 Installing Docker

* You need to access the launched Virtual Machine from `step-1` via a terminal.

* You can download the SSH Keys from SSH Keys tab or Overview page. Use this key to login to your virtual machine using the following command,

		 ssh -i path to/<private_key filename> root@<ipaddress>

* Update your apt sources

        echo 'deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main' >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
		sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
		sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
		sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-trusty

* Update your APT package index.

		sudo apt-get update
* Install Docker.

        sudo apt-get install docker-engine
* Start the docker daemon.

		sudo service docker start

##### Step-4 Run the Docker Registry

* Inside the virtual machine, Use the following command to run the docker registry.

Add an extra STORAGE_PATH=/registry  to create a child folder under `docker-registry` bucket. Apparently this didn't work for us.

		docker run \
         -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=ceph-s3 \
         -e AWS_BUCKET=docker-registry \
         -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \
         -e AWS_REGION=default \
         -e AWS_KEY=<access-key> \
         -e AWS_SECRET=<secret-key> \
         -e AWS_CALLING_FORMAT=boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat \
         -e AWS_PORT=80 \
         -e AWS_HOST=88.198.139.81 \
         -p 5000:5000 \
         registry

         /* enter your bucket-name here.that you are created in step-2.
        You can see your Access-key and Secret-key from your profile page in MegamAfrica(https://console.megamafrica.com) */

* Create a docker images by running the following command

Enter this command in your virtual machine

		sudo docker pull <imagename>
        eg: sudo docker pull hello-world
![](http://devcenter.megam.io/content/images/2016/06/p1-1.jpg)

*  Check if the image is downloaded in the VM

		docker images


![](http://devcenter.megam.io/content/images/2016/06/p3.jpg)

* Push downloaded docker image to your private registry.

As you are inside the VM, the private registry is running under `127.0.0.1:5000`

	sudo docker tag hello-world 127.0.0.1:5000/hello-world
	sudo docker push 127.0.0.1:5000/hello-world


![](http://devcenter.megam.io/content/images/2016/06/p2-1.jpg)

* Let us verify if the image is stored

Logon https://console.megamafrica.com goto storage place. You can see the docker images in file structure order.

* Grab the private regitry's ipaddress

    	ifconfig


![](http://devcenter.megam.io/content/images/2016/06/p4.jpg)

In our case the docker registry is running at 138.201.98.3.

##### Step-5 Pull a docker images

* Goto your workstation, Open the /etc/default/docker file

* Edit or add the DOCKER_OPTS line and add the `--insecure-registry flag`.

		DOCKER_OPTS="--insecure-registry <vm-ipaddress>:5000"

* Close and save the configuration file.

* Restart your Docker daemon

			service docker stop
    		service docker start

* To run the pull command, make sure docker is running

    	docker pull 138.201.98.3:5000/hello-world

### Conclusion

These are the very simple steps to create vm, utilize our atharva storage.

This is a good head-start for deploy a private docker-registry in MegamAfrica.
