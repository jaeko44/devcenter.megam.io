description: Design technique for building an API using scalaz
---

In [Part1](http://devcenter.megam.io/2015/03/18/rest_api_playframework/) we looked at how does the general RESTful API design for the input request look like.

We will use functional programming design technique - scalaz library and apply it to the design we have so far.

### Scalaz

[scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) is an extension of the core library for functional programming.


### Why functional ?

We can defer the computation until we need to actually do it.

Break programs in to partitioned computations

Just play with plain old data structures instead of fancy polymorphism types  like *AbstractBufferedToddlerReadyPlaySchool*.

We will not cover scalaz here, however you can refer a tutorial to [learn scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/).

Some of the libraries that we will use are

* scalaz.Validation
* scalaz.effect.IO
* scalaz.EitherT._
* scalaz.NonEmptyList._


More precisely the following will be imported.

    import scalaz._
    import scalaz.Validation._
    import Scalaz._
    import scalaz.effect.IO
    import scalaz.EitherT._
    import scalaz.Validation
    import scalaz.NonEmptyList._
    import scalaz.Validation.FlatMap._

The first concept we will study is about, *map*. This isn't a theory on monads, but talks about how we used it. so bear with me.

## map
    //A functor with one fuction.

    def map[B](f: A => B) : M[B]

For example you can convert a List of Ints to String. Why would you want to do that ? Lets just say we feel cool :).

    List[Int] -> List[String]

Lets change a list of Ints to Option[Int]

	val listT = List(1,2,3)

	listT.map(x => Some(x)) -> List[Option[Int]]

The next one we will use a lot is, *flatMap*.

## flatMap

    def flatMap[B](f: A => M[B]) : M[B]

Lets change a list of Ints to Option[Int]

    val fruits = Seq("apple", "banana", "orange")

    val ufruits = fruits.map(_.toUpperCase)

    //lets first map the fruits to make them uppper case
    :Seq[java.lang.String] = List(APPLE, BANANA, ORANGE)

    ufruits.flatMap(_.toUpperCase)

    //lets do a flatMap on the uppercased list
    :Seq[Char] = List(A, P, P, L, E, B, A, N, A, N, A, O, R, A, N, G, E)

## Validation

Many a times you will find *try catch* to be cumbersome in trapping errors. It becomes ugly where you start throwing down *exceptions* just to propogate and handle it.

Some times you need a *value* of the exception to proceed further or just halt there.

A better way would be to handle *exceptions* as a value. Here you can see that an *CannotAuthenticateError* is returned as below.  

    Validation.failure[Throwable, Option[String]](CannotAuthenticateError("""Invalid content in header. API server couldn't parse it""", "Request can't be funneled."))

    Validation.success[Throwable, Option[String](Some("Hurray I am done"))

There are two type parameters in the above **Throwable** and **Option[String]**

We will use the term

**Left**  to indicate the *failure* (Throwable) and

**Right** to indicate the *success* (Option[String])

During a failure, the *Left* is provided with the value of the failure.

During a success, the *Right* is provided with the success value.

### ValidatioNel

ValidationNel is a convinient method to wrap a NonEmptyList to the list of results. It can be useful where you want to concatenate the results of chained computation.

For instance - hit the guys head with a nail 10 times and tell the results of it what happened each time.

Did the guy duck or get it ?

    ValidationNel[Throwable, Option[Hit]]

There are convenient methods to change *Validation* to *ValidationNel*.

#### Where can you use ?

When you call your model to create something, you want to return all the results to the callee.

In the below code, we create an account and return the Left or Right to the callee.

### Model results
The first step is that we send  a json string to the model to store.

But first we need to validate it to a known schema *AccountInput* and see if it satisfies the same. If not we return an error **MalformedBodyError**

We wrap the schema extraction on **Validation.fromTryCatch** which results in **Left** or **Right** automatically.

So if we wanted to proceed with upon success of the schema validation we need to use a **flatMap**

So if we wanted to proceed with upon failure of the schema validation we need to use a **leftMap**

    def create(input: String): ValidationNel[Throwable, Option[AccountResult]] = {
    play.api.Logger.debug(("%-20s -->[%s]").format("models.Accounts", "create:Entry"))
    play.api.Logger.debug(("%-20s -->[%s]").format("input json", input))
    (Validation.fromTryCatch[models.AccountInput] {
      parse(input).extract[AccountInput]
    } leftMap { t: Throwable => new MalformedBodyError(input, t.getMessage)
    }).toValidationNel.flatMap

Ignore the *toValidationNel* for now. We will get to it in a minute.

So you saw how easy its to trap failure/success in a simple scenario.

By using **for comprehension** imagine the power to  chain computation which decides if it wants to proceed or exit out and inform the callee.

Sweet.

    for {
      m <- accountInput // verify the schema
      bal <- //create an empty billing record
      uid <- //get an unique id to store in riak
    } yield {
           //yield a success result
    }

So you just understood how to chain computations to arrive at a result, as opposed to the imperative style of a humongous loads of classes.

We are going to proceed further and explore calling our model a bunch of times and keep storing success or failure.

**toValidationNel**  is a helper method that lets you convert a **Validation** to **ValidationNel**

**ValidationNel** comes handy.

### ValidationNel put to use

Let us take a scenario where in our case when an user clicks the button **Marketplaces** we want to talk to the [gateway - REST API server](https://github.com/megamsys/megam_gateway.git)
![](http://devcenter.megam.io/content/images/2015/06/megam_marketplaces.png)

to display the Marketplaces screen
![](/content/images/2015/06/megam_marketplaces1.png)

Yeah. Here is the code.


    def findByName(marketPlacesNameList: Option[Stream[String]]): ValidationNel[Throwable, MarketPlaceResults] = {
    (marketPlacesNameList map {
      _.map { marketplacesName =>
        InMemory[ValidationNel[Throwable, MarketPlaceResults]]({
          cname: String =>  {
              (riak.fetch(marketplacesName) leftMap { t: NonEmptyList[Throwable] =>
                new ServiceUnavailableError(marketplacesName, (t.list.map(m => m.getMessage)).mkString("\n"))
              }).toValidationNel.flatMap { xso: Option[GunnySack] =>
                xso match {
                  case Some(xs) => {                    (Validation.fromTryCatchThrowable[models.MarketPlaceResult,Throwable] {                      parse(xs.value).extract[MarketPlaceResult]
                    } leftMap { t: Throwable =>
                      new ResourceItemNotFound(marketplacesName, t.getMessage)
                    }).toValidationNel.flatMap { j: MarketPlaceResult =>
                      Validation.success[Throwable, MarketPlaceResults](nels(j.some)).toValidationNel //screwy kishore, every element in a list ?
                    }
                  }
                  case None => Validation.failure[Throwable, MarketPlaceResults](new ResourceItemNotFound(marketplacesName, "")).toValidationNel
                }
              }
            }
        }).get(marketplacesName).eval(InMemoryCache[ValidationNel[Throwable, MarketPlaceResults]]())
      }
    } map {
      _.foldRight((MarketPlaceResults.empty).successNel[Throwable])(_ +++ _)
    }).head //return the folded element in the head.

  }


Lets examine the code. What we are saying here is

*I hand you a list of Option[marketplace names], call the db and get me a ValidationNel[Failure/Success result] for each of the list item*

- The first step is to **map** on the  *marketplaceName* and start unwrapping what is inside it.
- As the type is **Option[Stream]** we see a double map
- There is a State monad cache **InMemory** used here which basically caches *read only information* inmemory or memcache as configured. The design details of **State Monad** will be explained in another article.
- For every element *marketplacesName* see if it came out successful (**leftMap**), if not set **ResourceItemNotFound** for this result
- If the result is successsful, then validate its schema that was stored before and keep accumulating the result

**Note:** Here you see that the computation results are to be store in a list of ValidationNel's **List[ValidationNel]**

- At the end hence we use **fold** using a **Successful accumulator** to get the **head** which contains the results.

Super cool. eh!...


###Usage of flatMap

When you receive the result as `Validation`, the subsequent  computation needs to handle  (Left) or (Right).

To do so, we use our friend `flatMap`

In the below code, we marshall a json to a Scala object called models.AccountInput

    (Validation.fromTryCatch[models.AccountInput] {
      parse(input).extract[AccountInput]
    } leftMap { t: Throwable => new MalformedBodyError(input, t.getMessage)
    }).toValidationNel.flatMap { m: AccountInput =>

The result of the marshalling can result in an **exception** or **models.AccountInput** object

If the results are successful then the **flatMap** will provide the **AccountInput** object as seen above.


###either[T, S]  \/

Wait isn't either \/ disjunction appear like Validation.

**Note** either \/  is isomorphic to Validation.

What the heck is isomorphism. ?

Isomorphism is a very general concept that derives from the Greek iso, meaning "equal," and morphosis, meaning "to form" or "to shape."

Lets take this example and illustrate how either[T,S] differs from Validation.

For instance - hit the guys head with a nail 10 times and tell the singular result of failure or success by aggregating everything.

- 1st hit [Sucess]
- 2nd hit [Failure]
- 3rd hit [Success]

Did the guy duck or get it considering even on hit is a failure ? Yes the answer to the above is *[Failure]*

Lets study by taking an example.

    (for {
      resp <- eitherT[IO, NonEmptyList[Throwable], Option[AccountResult]] { //disjunction Throwabel \/ Option with a Function IO.
        (Accounts.findByEmail(freq.maybeEmail.get).disjunction).pure[IO]
      }
      found <- eitherT[IO, NonEmptyList[Throwable], Option[String]] {
        val fres = resp.get
        val calculatedHMAC = GoofyCrypto.calculateHMAC(fres.api_key, freq.mkSign)
        if (calculatedHMAC === freq.clientAPIHmac.get) {
          (("""Authorization successful for 'email:' HMAC matches:
            |%-10s -> %s
            |%-10s -> %s
            |%-10s -> %s""".format("email", fres.email, "api_key", fres.api_key, "authority", fres.authority).stripMargin)
            .some).right[NonEmptyList[Throwable]].pure[IO]
        } else {
          (nels((CannotAuthenticateError("""Authorization failure for 'email:' HMAC doesn't match: '%s'."""
            .format(fres.email).stripMargin, "", UNAUTHORIZED))): NonEmptyList[Throwable]).left[Option[String]].pure[IO]
        }
      }
    } yield found).run.map(_.validation).unsafePerformIO()
  }


  In the above there are two computations **resp, found** that are wrapped in  **eitherT[IO, NonEmptyList[Throwable], Option[T]]**

  The first computation returns the results of Account.findByEmail and wraps it in **pure[IO]**

  The second computation takes the success of the find and see if account is valid and can be authenticated.

  At the end of the computation you will notice that we yield  the **found** where we convert it to a **Validation** and tell scala to run the unsafe mode now.

I suppose we have given you an overall perspective of just 3 things in the **scalaz** world.

- map, flatMap
- Validation, ValidationNel
- eitherT

We had applied the same in how this was used in our awesome `api server` [https://github.com/megamsys](https://github.com/megamsys).
