### Introduction

Cassandra stores replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. A replication strategy determines the nodes where replicas are placed. The total number of replicas across the cluster is referred to as the replication factor.

A replication factor of 1 means that there is only one copy of each row in the cluster. A replication factor of 2 means two copies of each row, where each copy is on a different node. As a general rule, the replication factor should not exceed the number of nodes in the cluster. However, you can increase the replication factor and then add the desired number of nodes.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial :

* You need atleast two nodes.

* You need to install cassandra in all the nodes.

### Step 1 - Create a Keyspace in cql

* login into cqlsh

		cqlsh `ipaddress1`

* Creating a keyspace

		CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS `keyspacename` WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1' : 2 , 'dc2' : 2 };

* Two replication strategies of class are available:

* `SimpleStrategy` Use only for a single data center and one rack. If you ever intend more than one data center, use the NetworkTopologyStrategy.

* `NetworkTopologyStrategy` Highly recommended for most deployments because it is much easier to expand to multiple data centers when required by future expansion.

* Here, we are testing in multiple datacenter so we used NetworkTopologyStrategy class.



### Step 2 - Configure cassandra.yaml in dc1

* Its assumed that you have installed cassandra in the two nodes (dc1, dc2).

* Once you installed cassandra in your machine, then you need to change the cassandra yaml file in (dc1).

* Open the file `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` and change the following settings

		listen_address : `ipaddress`
        rpc_address    : `ipaddress`
		endpoint_snitch: GossipingPropertyFileSnitch

`Note` listen_address and rpc_address default is set localhost you need to change it to the private or public ipaddress (eg: 192.168.1.249).

`endpoint_snitch` by default is set for `SimpleSnitch` which works only for SimpleStrategy so you can changed the snitch to `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch`

* As we have used `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch` we need to change the file `/etc/cassandra/cassandra-rackdc.properties` with the datacenter and rack information.

* `cassandra-rackdc.properties` it used to tell we are using GossipingPropertyFileSnitch as endpoint.

* Define the Data Center and Rack that this node run on. The default settings:

        dc=DC1
		rack=RAC1
* Here, we are using two machines so change the file based on our setup.

        dc=DC1
		rack=RAC1
		dc=DC2
		rack=RAC1

* Add the above datacenter and rack in the `/etc/cassandra/cassandra-topology.properties`

* It look like this

		Data Center One
		175.56.12.105=DC1:RAC1
		175.50.13.200=DC1:RAC1
		175.54.35.197=DC1:RAC1

		120.53.24.101=DC1:RAC2
		120.55.16.200=DC1:RAC2
		120.57.102.103=DC1:RAC2

* Change the datacenter and rack into your ipaddress in that file.

		ipaddress1=DC1:RAC1
		ipaddress2=DC2:RAC1

* Use this command to check the data center name, and rack is set into your machine.

		nodetool status.

* Its show the status of the node.

        `UN` - define your node in up status.
        `DN` - define your node in down status.


### Step 3- Configure cassandra.yaml in dc2

* Its assumed that you have installed cassandra in the two nodes (dc1, dc2).

* Once you installed cassandra in your machine, then you need to change the cassandra yaml file in (dc2 as well).

Repeat the process in as many racks/datacenters.

### Conclusion

These are the very simple steps to setup cassandra replications in several nodes.
